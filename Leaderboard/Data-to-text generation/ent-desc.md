It is a large-scale and challenging dataset to facilitate the study of such a practical scenario in KG-to-text. The dataset involves retrieving abundant knowledge of various types of main entities from a large knowledge graph (KG), which makes the current graph-to-sequence models severely suffer from the problems of information loss and parameter explosion while generating the descriptions.

### Overview

| Dataset  | Num Train | Num Valid | Num Test | Source Length (Avg) | Target Length (Avg) |
