**S**tanford **Qu**estion **A**nswering **D**ataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

### Overview

'Denver Broncos [SEP] Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League ( NFL ) for the 2015 season . The American Football Conference ( AFC ) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Carolina Panthers 24 â€“ 10 to earn their third Super Bowl title . The game was played on February 7 , 2016 , at Levi \' s Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara , California . As this was the 50th Super Bowl , the league emphasized the " golden anniversary " with various gold - themed initiatives , as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals ( under which the game would have been known as " Super Bowl L " ) , so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50 .'
