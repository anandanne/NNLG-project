The NewsQA dataset is a crowd-sourced machine reading comprehension dataset of 120,000 question-answer pairs.

- Documents are CNN news articles.
- Questions are written by human users in natural language.
- Answers may be multiword passages of the source text.
- Questions may be unanswerable.
- NewsQA is collected using a 3-stage, siloed process.
- Questioners see only an articleâ€™s headline and highlights.
- Answerers see the question and the full article, then select an answer passage.
- Validators see the article, the question, and a set of answers that they rank.
- NewsQA is more natural and more challenging than previous datasets.

"What is going live on Tuesday ? [X_SEP] ( CNN ) -- Comcast rolled out a Web-based on-demand television and movie service on Tuesday that gives customers access to more than 2,000 hours of television and movies . The move comes as users increasingly are bypassing their TV sets and heading straight to the Web -- both legally and illegally -- to watch their favorite shows . The service , named Fancast XFINITY TV ( formerly called TV Everywhere ) , is the biggest cable industry initiative to keep people from skipping traditional TV service in the United States . `` I watch TV online every day . I find it more convenient than my regular TV ... , '' Michael Heard , a self-employed computer repairman from Atlanta , Georgia , said via e-mail . `` I 'm usually watching TV on one window while reading e-mail or tweets on another . `` And also my time is important , so sitting down and watching a show at 8 or 9 p.m. is n't convenient . Online TV allows me to watch what I want when I want . '' Networks have tried for the past couple of years to find a way to reach Web-watching audiences by streaming content on their Web sites or making partnerships with Hulu , one of the larger online TV sites . Now , Comcast is hoping it can make a dent in the market by serving up premium content . It is available to all Comcast customers , so long as they subscribe to both Internet and Cable service . Heard said he does n't expect to give up Hulu , though many of the same episodes and Web clips will be available on Fancast . Heard , trying out the site Tuesday after it went live , tweeted that he thought the service was `` awesome , '' and he finally had a place where he could watch the entire series of `` The Sopranos . '' `` The quality , it 's really clear and loads fast , '' he said , though he noted there were still some bugs in the product . Heard occasionally had to reload the site , and felt that installing the video player and authorizing the computer took a bit more time and was harder than simply pressing play on Hulu . The service is getting mixed reviews on Twitter , with customers giving instant feedback about their experiences . Some complained that high-definition videos , which are available on Hulu , are not available on Comcast 's service . Others complained about having to download a separate video player , the service not being compatible with the Linux operating system , and only being able to authorize the service on a total of three computers . Comcast hopes to wow customers even more in the future . In the next six months , after the service has gone through more beta testing , the company plans to open the service to a broader customer base . Customers will be able to access all content -- depending on the tiered level of service they subscribe to . Those not paying for HBO regularly , for example , wo n't be able to snag the newest episode of `` Curb Your Enthusiasm '' online . In addition to catching up with sites like Hulu and Clicker , Comcast executives told media outlets they expect to serve up a feature that Tivo fans have come to love -- allowing customers to program their DVR from afar . Executives said they hope the service would be available in about six months . To access the content , users simply need to log in with their Comcast e-mail address at fancast.com . The site is offering live online help , including help retrieving those addresses ."
